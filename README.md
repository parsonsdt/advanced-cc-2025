## Course Descriptions

Advanced Critical Computation is a continuation of the principles and techniques taught in Critical Computation. Students will expand their conceptual and technical skills in the pursuit of mastering code and procedurality as a tool for creative, critical, and aesthetic exploration and expression. Topics will include algorithms, object-oriented programming, and the historical and cultural context of software in art and design. We will focus on building more complex systems and exploring specific creative applications of code. Students will work HTML, CSS, and Javascript to produce five creative projects throughout the semester. 

## Learning Objectives 
1. Demonstrate knowledge and application of fundamental programming skills in p5.js and Javascript. 2. Develop a deep understanding of the relationship between code and design. 
3. Manipulate data and text critically, via APIs, databases, and regular expressions. 
4. Critically discuss and create work drawing from historical precedents of computational literature, critical design, as well as understanding the Internet as a site for intervention.
